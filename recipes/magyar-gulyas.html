    <h1>Magyar Gulyas Recipe</h1>

    <p>Look man, i could sit here and waste my time filling this page<br>
    with actual instructions and stuff on how to make this dish but, i'm learning<br>
    web development not cooking and I'm bored of html and i wanna get to the css already<br>
    because that parts really cool. So i'm just gonna make a couple lists, fill em with nonsense. <br>
    Go ahead and add some links here and there, different headers, pictures and stuff. Just practicing <br>
    using elements and writing decent commits and stuff so if for some reason you're a future employer and <br>
    you're checking my repos to see what I've made so far... Please don't take this too seriously this was my <br>
    starting point/ pet project where I'm just trying to get a handle on things hehe.</p>
