    <h1>Pizza recipe</h1>
    <p>A bunch of stuff on this page won't make that much sense<br>
    unless you read the gulyas recipe first. Luckily for you I'm going to<br>
    give you a link to it here so you don't have to go back and click on it<br>
    from the list of recipes. Here you go, go there first, I'll wait :D</p>

    <p>Alright anyway, my formatting could be better, a lot of my paragraphs are <br>
    pretty un-uniform. The way they just continue to increase in length with each <br>
    line. So I'm trying to work on that in this page. Here's a picture of some <br>
    pizza as if that's actually of relevance lol.</p>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>God knows what I'm gonna write here or how I'm gonna fill this part.<br>
    Alright lets see, I've had a video game addiction for a long time. I've <br>
    been working on becoming more productive in my life. That's part of the <br>
    reason that I've been trying to learn web development. I've been trying <br>
    to introduce good habits into my life slowly, especially with the fact <br>
    that my semester has just ended and it's summer right now. Normally, <br>
    over the course of the summer, I just turn into a lazy slob and do nothing <br>
    for 2-3 months. Then I'd spend my semester blaming my irresponsible behavior <br>
    on the fact that I spent my entire summer doing nothing productive and then <br>
    use that as en excuse to enable my behavior. That's pretty unhealthy. <br>
    This summer is different and here's my plan.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Make a rough daily routine with certain tasks to try to complete everyday.</li>
        <li>Attempt to wake up early to get a head-start on the day.</li>
        <li>Remind myself that I always feel better after doing these productive things.</li>
        <li>Begin to enjoy the productive tasks while completing them and not just after the fact.</li>
        <li>Stop relying on motivation and allow the productivity to become a habit that requires more <br>
            energy to stop doing the to continue doing.</li>
        <li>Carry over my new routine to the school period so that I can effortlessly replace one <br>
            or two of the tasks with school work and reach new levels and prove to myself that I can <br>
            I can do anything i put my mind to and that I'm capable of anything</li>
        <li>Yeah that's the plan. Here are some of the tasks I'm trying to give myself</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wake up no later than 10:30</li>
        <li>Go do anything active like jump rope, calisthenics, running, gym, genuinely anything.</li>
        <li>Stretching and flexibility training.</li>
        <li>Come home and meditate</li>
        <li>Take a rejuvenating cold shower to relax my muscles and give me energy to be productive.</li>
        <li>Make a healthy breakfast, probably a smoothie.</li>
        <li>Do some kind of work. In this case right now, practice html/ css.</li>
        <li>Relax, play some League, Valorant, or just spend time with someone I love.</li>
        <li>Honestly, from this point onwards, I play it by ear. If I managed to do everything <br>
            that I've listed so far. That's a pretty good day for the books so I can afford to<br>
            just take the rest of the day for myself because I've earned it.</li>
        <li>Ideally I'd do some reading at least before bed. I've been enjoying reading a lot<br>
        recently.</li>
        <li>Things have been going well so far. I don't always do everything on the list. <br>
            But, I almost always do at least something. And that's huge progress for me.</li>
    </ol>
