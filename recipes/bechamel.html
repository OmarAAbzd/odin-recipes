            <li>Ground Beef</li>
            <li>Veg Oil</li>
            <li>Onion</li>
            <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
            <li>Cinnamon</li>
            <li>Black Pepper</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Chicken Stock or stock cube</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat Oven</li>
            <li>Boil pasta to al dente</li>
            <li>Dice onion and cook in pan with vegetable oil until soft.</li>
            <li>Add meat to pan with onion and break apart with wooden spoon. Cook until browned.</li>
            <li>Add spices and tomato sauce, let simmer for 5 minutes and set aside.</li>
            <li>Melt butter over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add flour a few tables spoons at a time while continuously whisking.</li>
            <li>Warm your milk by microwaving it just above room temperature.</li>
            <li>Pour the milk slowly while continuously similarly to the flour. If the sauce is sticking to the pan, turn down the heat.</li>
            <li>Add chicken stock to the milk once it's done. Continue to whisk for 4-5 minutes. Running the spoon through the pan, <br>the sauce should remain separated for a period of time before returning to its form.</li>
            <li>Mix pasta with roughly 1 cup of the Sauce</li>
            <li>In a casserole dish, add a tablespoon of the sauce and spread it around, then add half the pasta.</li>
            <li>Add all of the meat mixture on top and even out the layer, then add the remaining pasta.</li>
            <li>Cover with all the bechamel sauce and smoothen it out. There should be enough sauce to cover the entire top well.</li>
            <li>Cover the casserole with aluminum foil and bake at 375F for 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Uncover the pasta, break an egg on top of it and spread it atop the pasta. Broil for 15 minutes to brown the top and allow the egg to give the top a nice crust on the top.</li>
            <li>Allow the pasta to cool for 15-20 minutes to set, then cut into pieces and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
